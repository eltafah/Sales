Superstore SQL Queries 
This repository contains SQL code that performs various queries on a sample data set of a superstore. The data set has information about the orders, customers, products, sales, and profits of the superstore in different regions and segments. The SQL code demonstrates how to:

View the entire table or select specific columns from the table
Filter the table by certain conditions using the WHERE clause
Sort the table by one or more criteria using the ORDER BY clause
Aggregate the table by one or more categories using the GROUP BY clause
Calculate the sum, average, and other statistics using the aggregate functions
Limit the number of rows returned by the query using the TOP or LIMIT clause
The SQL code is written for SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), but it can be adapted for other SQL platforms with minor changes. The code is commented and formatted for easy readability and understanding. The code can be used as a reference or a starting point for further analysis and exploration of the data set.
